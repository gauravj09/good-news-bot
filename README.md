# Good News Bot
In this age of sensationalism, we often fall prey to echo chamber rhetorics and pessimistic worldview. Good News Bot attempts to solve this problem by scraping through over 170 headlines across the entire country to give you the most curated good news of the day. The project is currently in developed using NewsAPI, tweepy and Google NLP (soon to be replaced by BERT).
