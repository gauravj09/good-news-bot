# Good News Bot
Good News Bot tweets exclusively good news everyday. The good news is scraped from 
NewsAPI after analysing over 170 headlines from more than 50 countries using 
the Google NLP API.  

# Inspiration and Inner Workings
In this age of sensationalism, we often fall prey to echo chamber rhetoric and 
pessimistic worldview. Good News Bot attempts to solve this problem by performing 
sentiment analysis over all the top headlines in the world. Using confidence_score and 
confidence_magnitude provided by the Google NLP API, this twitter bot avoids 
deceptive headlines, clickbait articles that make you feel frustrated about the 
world.

# Future Plans
This project is currently being developed using the NewsAPI, tweepy 
and Google NLP. To bypass API limits, Google NLP will soon be replaced by BERT.
There is a possibility that this bot may be expanded into a web or mobile 
application. Any feedback is appreciated!
